# LoRa_0.433M_0.865M
This dataset consists of 1,080 antenna designs that resonate at 433 MHz, 865 MHz, and dual-frequency operation. The dataset is structured as follows:  Rows 2 to 123: Represent S11 parameters (dB) for each antenna design across different frequency points. Rows 124 to 129: Contain design features and parameters influencing antenna performance.
Each row corresponds to a unique antenna design with varying geometries, materials, or other tuning parameters affecting resonance characteristics. This dataset can be used for analyzing return loss (S11) behavior, optimizing antenna structures, and exploring trends in dual-frequency operation.
